# Clonning the rep - without adding directory 
so I clicked on clone rep on VS code and it took me to git and asked authorization to link both! 

I don't know if that was a good thing or not that I authorized em to link 

but now instead of cloning using the terminal (that didn't work), 

it gave me the option to clone using the Command Palette.
